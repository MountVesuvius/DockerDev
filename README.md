# DockerDev 

This is a development environment contained within a docker container. The goal was to keep everything from work in a single environment so it doesn't touch anything on my system.

## Internal FAQ:
Inner monologue: Is this the smartest way to go about this?
Answer: Probably not

Inner monologue: Will this cause no end of issues when it comes to maintanence?
Answer: Honestly I have no clue, I'm hoping it makes my life easier

Inner monologue: Why did you bother making this?
Answer: I wanted to learn a bit of docker, and try out Neovim 0.9 since I'm still using 0.7 as my daily driver

Inner monologue: Why are all the plugins and LSP in the config folder?
Answer: The plugins I can remove and they should get built on the creation of the docker image. However, I can't figure out how to setup the LSP's at the moment and it's giving me a headache. Therefore, hehehaha fatty config for future me to deal with.
