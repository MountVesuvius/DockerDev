step by step:
create the dockerfile to build an image of my development setup

create a git repo that i can clone onto a machine to build my docker image

write a bash script that can be run to install all the required software to build the above work

write a bunch of global commands to enter my dev setup without hassle


note:
- learn how to use tmux
- load into tmux directly
- fix this damn awful bash shell

current:
- bash script that updates the bashrc to add the idew idep commands
- since this will be an entire env not just nvim, the global bashrc will need to auto load into this rather than selecting a project and working on it like that

packages to add:
- clang
